## Data transparency and privacy policy

For more information about the latest privacy policy see the [related page](https://github.com/MrSinho/notepad-mono/blob/main/PRIVACY_POLICY.md). You can also read the latest privacy policy matching the installed application version by going to user info icon in the top right of the screen, then click `account settings` and `privacy policy`.

## Delete user account

To successfully eliminate your Notepad Mono account and all of the data associated with that account (email address, username, profile picture, notes data) you can simply navigate to the user info icon in the top right of the screen, then click `account settings`, followed by `delete account` and confirm the deletion. This way all the data associated with the current email address will be permanently deleted once the delete request gets received (this action cannot be undone). You can still create a new account using the same address and auth provider.

## Delete all user associated data

If you want to delete all of your data (including notes) but keep the account, navigate to the user info icon in the top right of the screen, then click `account settings`, followed by `delete user data` and confirm the deletion.
